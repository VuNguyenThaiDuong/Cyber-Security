# Cryptography

## Overview
Comprehensive study of cryptographic principles and applications.

## Topics Covered
- Symmetric encryption algorithms (AES, DES, 3DES)
- Asymmetric cryptography (RSA, ECC)
- Cryptographic hash functions (SHA family, MD5)
- Digital signatures and their role in authentication
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Certificates, and Certificate Authorities
- Key exchange protocols (Diffie-Hellman, ECDH)
- Cryptanalysis basics and attack vectors
- Cryptographic protocols (TLS/SSL, IPSec)

## Practical Applications
- Implementing secure communication channels
- Creating and verifying digital signatures
- Managing certificates and trust chains
- Study of real-world vulnerabilities and mitigation
